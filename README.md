# Swabs2Labs - CNI Hackathon 

This repository contains our (Team Mallocators -- Arpan Dasgupta, Kunal Jain, Nikhil Chandak, Shashwat Goel) work we did during 
the Swabs2Labs Hackathon organized by CNI, IISc Bangalore.

## About

Swabs2Labs is a project undertaken by the Centre for Networked Intelligence that deals with the allocation of collected test swabs to testing labs in an efficient manner. This project has been undertaken in conjunction with Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Karnataka State Government, and is part of the centreâ€™s efforts to analyze, model and develop tools to tackle the COVID-19 epidemic.
In the absence of a medical cure to tackle COVID-19, test-contact trace-isolate has been the preferred strategy of health officials all over the world. In Karnataka, nearly one lakh samples are tested per day across its 30 districts, and there are more than hundred testing labs across the state. Efficient allocation of collected test swabs to various testing laboratories is a pressing operational requirement. In this context, can you design an efficient mechanism that can allocate test swabs to various labs in the state? The mechanism should take into account several operational requirements and constraints, such as:

* Out of district transfers should be minimised.
* When transferring to more than one lab outside the source district, the labs should be close by, so that transportation costs are minimised.
* Cost of testing depends on the type of lab (govt.  or private).

## Report

The report contains intricacies about our solution methodology. It has all the implementation details, proof for lower bounds, our benchmarks, and robustness. 

## Presentation

We had prepared 2 presentation files:

*   Finalist Presentation: This presentation contains the slides prepared for finalist presentation.
*   Video Presentation: This presentation contains the slides prepared to make a video of our solution which shall be used by the organizers to pitch our work to the Karnataka Health Department.

## Submission

The Mallocators_Submission folder contains our final submission for the Hackathon, with detailed instructions on how to run the code and libraries/software needed to install.
